        <h3>Second part</h3>
        At the end of this part, video frames will be divided into three categories. Each category is represented by
        index of suitability. There are three indexes of suitability: 0,4 and 5. Video frame with index 0 is
        supposed to be the ideal frame and the complete registration algorithm is applied.
    </p>
    <p>Video frame with index 4 means the video frame is supposed to be blurred, or with light reflection. Therefore
        there is a high probability that the registration of this video frame can fail when the control maximal
        registration shift would be exceeded. Video frame with index 5 will be written to the new video without
        any changes.

        <h4>Control averages</h4>
        The value of POC function maxim can be used as a video frame quality mark, along with entropy and tennengrad.
        If the value of absolute POC function maximum <i>SHAMPf</i> is used to calculate indicator <i>PMPf</i>
        using the equation

        The lower <i>PMPf</i> indicator is, the more sharper the video frame is and vice versa. The value of the
        indicator
        vary from 18 to 90. To compare video frames using this indicator, it is necessary to calculate average
        <i>PMPf</i>
        from the video frames, which were marked as suitable video frames at the end of the first part using the
        referential video frame.
