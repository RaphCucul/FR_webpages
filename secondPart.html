        <h3>Second part</h3>
        At the end of this part, frames are divided into three categories. Each category is represented by
        index of suitability (so-called evaluation index in the program itself). There are three indexes of suitability: 0, 1, 4 and 5. Frame with index 0 is
        supposed to be the ideal frame and the complete registration algorithm is applied.
    </p>
    <p>Index 1 says a frame contains some light artefact or is slightly blurred, but the registration algorithm can process this frame. 
        Index 4 means a frame is more 'damaged' then a frame with index 1. Therefore,
        there is a high probability that the registration of this frame can fail. Incomplete registration algorithm is applied on a frame 
        with index 4.Video frame with index 5 will be written to the new video without
        any changes (or it may be skipped, depends on user's setting).
    </p>

        <h4>Control averages</h4>
        The value of POC function maximum can be used as a frame quality mark, along with entropy and tennengrad.
        The value of absolute POC function maximum <i>SHAMPf</i> is used to calculate indicator <i>PMPf</i>
        using the equation:

    </p>
    <p>
        The lower <i>PMPf</i> indicator is, the more sharper the video frame is and vice versa. The value of the
        indicator
        vary from 18 to 90. To compare frames using this indicator, it is necessary to calculate average
        <i>PMPf</i>
        from those frames marked as suitable for the registration in the end of the first part.
