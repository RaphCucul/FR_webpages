        <h3>Videoframes registration</h3>
        The program is based on a console application written in C++ aimed on the registration of videoframes, using
        OpenCV libraries, which are used for image processing. The source code of the console app with additional
        informations (in Czech) can be found <a href="https://www.vutbr.cz/studenti/zav-prace/detail/110555">here</a>.
        Check the <a href="https://github.com/RaphCucul/Frames-registration/wiki">Wiki</a> page to learn more about the program.
    </p>
    <p>
        The program is designed to register videoframes with specific content - retinal fundus.
        The example of such videoframe is shown below.

    <p>
        The program is using Frangi filter during videoframe preprocessing. The code for Frangi filter can be found
        <a href="https://github.com/ntnu-bioopt/libfrangi.git">here</a>.
        The program was created using OpenCV 3.2.0 and Qt 5.9.1. To run the program properly, it is necessary to modify phase
        correlation functions in the OpenCV source before compiling the libraries. Folder
        <a href="https://github.com/RaphCucul/Frames-registration/tree/master/OpenCV_phaseCorr">OpenCV_phaseCorr</a> contains
        the files with modified content. If the newer version of OpenCV is used, it is necessary to implement changes
        shown in those files.

        <h3>Sources of extra content</h3>
        It was already mentioned in the text above, that this program uses third party Frangi filter C++ implementation.
        But the program also contains icons. Some of them can be found here:

        Some of them were created in the online tool <a href="https://vectr.com">Vectr</a>.
         The rest was created in GIMP.
