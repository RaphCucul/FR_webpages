        <h3>Videoframes registration</h3>
        The program is based on a console application written in C++ aimed on the registration of frames, using
        OpenCV library image processing functions. The source code of the console app with additional
        informations (in Czech) can be found <a href="https://www.vutbr.cz/studenti/zav-prace/detail/110555">here</a>.
        Check the <a href="https://github.com/RaphCucul/Frames-registration/wiki">Wiki</a> page to learn more about the program.
    </p>
    <p>
        The program is designed to register frames with specific content - retinal fundus.
        The example of such videoframe is shown below.

        The program is using Frangi filter during the frame preprocessing. The source code for Frangi filter can be found
        <a href="https://github.com/ntnu-bioopt/libfrangi.git">here</a>.
        The program was created using OpenCV 3.2.0 and Qt 5.9.1. To run the program properly, it is necessary to modify phase
        correlation functions in the OpenCV source before compiling the library. Folder
        <a href="https://github.com/RaphCucul/Frames-registration/tree/master/OpenCV_phaseCorr">OpenCV_phaseCorr</a> contains
        files with modified content.

        <h3>Sources of extra content</h3>
        As mentioned above, this program uses third party Frangi filter implementation.
        But the program also contains icons. Some of them can be found here:

        <li><a href="https://icons8.com/iconizer/en/search/1/collection:Fugue_Icons">Fugue icons</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://icons8.com/iconizer/en/search/1/collection:Free_Applications_Icons">Free applications icons</a></li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        Some of them were created in the online tool <a href="https://vectr.com">Vectr</a>. The rest was created in GIMP.
