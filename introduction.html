        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        The scheme mapping the whole algorithm is shown below. For better description, the whole algorithm is divided into three 
        logical parts. Each part has its own page.

        First two parts check if all frames are suitable for the registration. Several methods is used to evaluate 
        every frame to minimize the chance a good frame would be marked as unsuitable for the registration. When the 
        second part is finished, lists of good and bad frames are created and used as the input for the third part.
